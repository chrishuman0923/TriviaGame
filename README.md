# Trivia Game

A video game themed trivia game demonstrating the use of jquery and intervals to manipulate DOM objects. The deployed project can be found [here](https://chrishuman0923.github.io/triviaGame/).

## Functionality

Upon clicking the start button, the game displays one question at a time while allowing 10 seconds for the user to answer each question. Once a question is answered, the timer resets and a new question appears. If the user fails to answer the question in the allotted time, the game moves on to the next quesiton and the timer resets. Once all of the questions have been answered or time has expired, the game displays the number of questions answered correctly and incorrectly, as well as a restart button allowing for the game to be played again.

## Getting Started

1. Click Start
2. Answer Questions
3. Click Restart

## Notes

All of the game behavior and functionality takes place without the browser window refreshing.

## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Javascript
- JQuery
- Intervals

## Future Enhancements
A future enhancement would include the ability for the application to shuffle the trivia questions each time the game is started.
