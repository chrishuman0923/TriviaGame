# Trivia Game

A video game themed trivia game demonstrating the use of jquery and intervals to manipulate DOM objects. You can view the deployed project [here](https://chrishuman0923.github.io/TriviaGame/).

# Game Rules

Upon clicking the start button, the game displays one question at a time while allowing 10 seconds for the user to answer each question. Once a question is answered, the timer resets and a new question appears. If the user fails to answer the question in the allotted time, the game moves on to the next quesiton and the timer resets. Once all of the questions have been answered or time has expired, the game displays the number of questions answered correctly and incorrectly, as well as a restart button allowing for the game to be played again.

# Notes

All of the game behavior and functionality takes place without the browser window refreshing.
